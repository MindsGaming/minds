## Download and Provisioning

- Git
- Docker


## Installing and Building Developer version

We used Linux Mint on VirtualBox to test and create this install guide.

First we need to install a few things like docker. To do this on Mint or Ubuntu using the application store is the easiest way, just search docker and install the following packages;

Docker

Docker-compose

Docker-containerd

Docker-registry

Docker.io

Now we can install git, to do this open the terminal {CTRL + ALT +T} and type;

sudo apt-get install git

Now we need to install Minds, do not use sudo here

git clone https://github.com/Minds/minds.git

Once this is done we need to open the file for Minds in the same terminal.

cd minds

Now we can follow Minds install instructions;

Fist in order to install the front and engine repositories run;

sh init.sh

Next;

sudo docker-compose up -d nginx

Next;

sudo docker-compose up installer

sudo docker-compose up front-build

Alright now we need to set-up our hosts, to do this we are going to run;

sudoedit /etc/host

We are going to paste and save the local host

http://localhost:8080

Once saved open the link in your browser.

Troubleshooting

Cassandra Doesnâ€™t run;

Try;

sudo docker-compose up front-build

Or run;

sudo docker-compose up cassandra

---------------------------------

Production System Requirements

At this time it is not advisable to run Minds in production, however it is possible so long as you are aware of the risks.

    3 Cassandra Nodes (Min 30gb RAM, 1TB SSD, 8 CPU)
    1 ElasticSearch Node (Min 16GB RAM, 250GB SSD, 8 CPU) #2 nodes are recommended for failover
    1 Docker Machine (Min 60gb RAM, 50GB SSD, 32 CPU)
